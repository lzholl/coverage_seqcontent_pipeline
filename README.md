# brown-ccv-gds-summer-2022

Thank you for taking the time to complete this programming assignment. Through this exercise, we seek to get an insight into:
* your technical skills
* approach to problem solving
* software development practices

Members of our group come from very diverse backgrounds. We understand that methodologies vary greatly depending on your background. While we provide some guidance on technology and approach, you are welcome to use the approach and technology that you are most comfortable with and gives you a fair opportunity to complete the assignment and show us your best work.

If completing this assignment would be an undue burden, please reach out and we will work with you to find another way to assess your technical experience.

## Tasks to be completed

For this assignment, you will create a simple pipeline that calculates the coverage of an Illumina MiSeq data set against a reference sequence after alignment using a tool such as BWA, and tests for correlation between coverage and sequence content of the reference. The choice of technologies, metrics and visualizations are design choices that we are pourposely leaving up to you. However, feel free to reach out if you have questions. Below are some things we like, which may help you guide your choices:

* We are fans of well formatted code, comments, types, modularity
* We are fans of interactive visualizations
* We are fans of a good README.md
* We are fans of conventional commits

## Deliverables
* Source code. We will share a starter repository containing this README with you. Please commit all code (no build files please!) to this repo.
* Updated README.md with explanations about how to run your code and an overview of the application and any major design decisions you made.
* Demonstration of results of working application.

Please try your best. We'll evaluate whatever you provide us, even if your solution is incomplete.

## Time to completion
You have one week to complete the assignment.

## After completion
You will hear from us regarding next steps within 15 days. Continuing candidates will be invited for the next steps in the process.
